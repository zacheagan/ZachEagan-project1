# ZachEagan-project1

Goals:

The goal of this first project was to find out music interest based on certain questions that I set up in an anonymous survey in men ages 18-22. I set out to find if there is a difference between region, major, and favorite genre of music in relation to how much that indivual likes music, and how many hours of music they listen to a day. 

Data Types:

The first attribute was Region, which is a String data type. Region is simply what area of the country the person was from. The regions I used were: North East, South East, Mid West, South West, and West. athe next attribute was Major, which is a String data type. This was simply what major the person was, the majors ranged from Biology to Communications. Continuing, the next data type was Favorite Music Genre, which is a String data type. This is the persons favorite music genre. I was accepting any music genre, but the 4 I received were: Rap, R&B, Country, and Pop. The next attribute was Hours listened a day, which is an integer data type. This was a 1-10 scale, and was how much a person on average listened to music in one day. The final attribute was Music Approval Rating, which is an integer data type. This was simply a 1-10 scale on how much a person thinks they like music

Potential Biases:
There are a couple potential biases in this data. The first is survey bias, this comes from asking the questions in person. This may skew how the person responds as they may alter their answers to conform to more "normal" responses. I do not think this is a big bias factor in my data. The next bias that may arise is the population I chose my participants from. The participants were from the same general population of UT students ranging from 18-22. This group of popular are more likely to listen to more modern hip hop music, compared to a 70 year old thatnis more likely to listen to older music. I think this may have altered my data, but I altered my goals from a more broad goal of the whole population to specifically men ages 18-22.
