# ZachEagan-project1

Goals:

The goal of this first project was to find out music interest based on certain questions that I set up in an anonymous survey. I set out to find if there is a difference between region, major, and favorite genre of music in relation to how much that indivual likes music, and how many hours of music they listen to a day. 

Data Types:

The first attribute was Region, which is a String data type. The way I obtained Region in the survery was simple, I asked "What area of the country are you from?". The regions I used were: North East, South East, Mid West, South West, and West. The next attribute was Major, which is a String data type. Similar to Region I asked, "What Major do you study at UT?". The Majors ranged from Biology all the way to Communications. Continuing, the next data type was Favorite Music Genre, which is a String. I asked in the survey, "What is your favorite music genre". I was accepting any music genre, but the 4 I received were: Rap, R&B, Country, and Pop. I will address why there were so few genres when I discuss potential biases. The next attrivute was Hours listened a day, which is an integer data type. This variable was obtained in the same manner asking, "On average how many hours of music do you typically listen to in a day? This can be at the gym, in the shower, studying, any manner you set out to consume music in". This variable was interesting as the numbers ranged, and many people had to think about how many hours they would spend listening to music. The final attribute was Music Approval Rating, which is an integer data type. 

The first attribute was Region, which is a String data type. Region is simply what area of the country the person was from. The regions I used were: North East, South East, Mid West, South West, and West.
